I am a user of [Telehack](https://telehack.com), an online simulation of ARPANET of the 80's, a blend of retrocomputing museum and computer game.
The programs here are written in Telehack's TH BASIC, a reimagination of the original Dartmouth University "TeleBasic" (~1965).

```
10 PRINT "HELLO WORLD"
20 GOTO 10
```
